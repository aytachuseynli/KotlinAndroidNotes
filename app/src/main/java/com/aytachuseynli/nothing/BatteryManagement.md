# Detailed Best Practices for Battery Management in Android

## 1. Using WorkManager

WorkManager is the recommended way to handle background processing in a battery-efficient manner.

- **Features**: Handles work constraints (like requiring network connectivity), persists work across device restarts, and respects battery optimization.
- **Implementation**: 
  ```kotlin
  val workRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<YourWorker>()
      .setConstraints(Constraints.Builder()
          .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.CONNECTED)
          .build())
      .build()
      
  WorkManager.getInstance(context).enqueue(workRequest)
  ```
- **Benefits**: The system intelligently batches work requests, potentially delaying low-priority tasks until the device is charging.

## 2. Implement Lazy Loading

Lazy loading reduces initial power consumption by loading resources only when needed.

- **Technique**: Initialize heavy resources only when they're actually required rather than at app startup.
- **Example**:
  ```kotlin
  // Instead of loading at startup
  // val heavyResource = loadHeavyResource()
  
  // Use lazy delegation
  val heavyResource by lazy { loadHeavyResource() }
  
  // Or create a function that loads on demand
  private var heavyResource: Resource? = null
  private fun getHeavyResource(): Resource {
      if (heavyResource == null) {
          heavyResource = loadHeavyResource()
      }
      return heavyResource!!
  }
  ```

## 3. Batch Network Requests

Multiple small network requests consume more battery than fewer batched ones.

- **Implementation**: Use batch APIs when available or create client-side batching.
- **Example**: Instead of syncing each item independently, collect changes and sync them in one network call.
- **Tools**: Libraries like Retrofit allow you to combine multiple API calls.
- **Benefits**: Reduces radio activation cycles, which are major battery drains.

## 4. Optimize Wakelocks

Wakelocks prevent the device from entering sleep mode but can drain battery rapidly if misused.

- **Best Practice**: Acquire wakelocks for the minimum time needed.
- **Implementation**:
  ```kotlin
  val wakeLock = (context.getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE) as PowerManager)
      .newWakeLock(PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, "YourApp:WakelockTag")
  
  try {
      wakeLock.acquire(10*60*1000L) // 10 minutes max
      // Do critical work
  } finally {
      wakeLock.release()
  }
  ```
- **Warning Signs**: If your app uses wakelocks frequently or for long periods, redesign your approach.

## 5. Use JobScheduler API

JobScheduler helps schedule tasks to run at optimal times for battery life.

- **Use Cases**: Data syncing, uploading analytics, prefetching content.
- **Implementation**:
  ```kotlin
  val jobScheduler = context.getSystemService(Context.JOB_SCHEDULER_SERVICE) as JobScheduler
  val jobInfo = JobInfo.Builder(JOB_ID, ComponentName(context, YourJobService::class.java))
      .setRequiresCharging(true)
      .setRequiredNetworkType(JobInfo.NETWORK_TYPE_UNMETERED)
      .build()
      
  jobScheduler.schedule(jobInfo)
  ```
- **Benefits**: The system can batch similar jobs from different apps, reducing wake-ups.

## 6. Monitor Battery Statistics

Use Android Profiler to identify battery usage patterns.

- **Tools**: Android Studio Profiler, Battery Historian, ADB battery stats.
- **What to Look For**: Excessive wake-ups, high CPU usage when idle, network activity patterns.
- **Testing**: Compare your app's energy profile before and after optimizations.

## 7. Test Under Battery Saver Mode

Ensure your app behaves correctly under battery restrictions.

- **Testing Approach**: Enable Battery Saver mode during development testing.
- **What Changes**: Background operations are limited, location updates reduced, and network activity may be deferred.
- **Handling**: Create fallback mechanisms for critical features that might be affected.

## 8. Implement Foreground Services Correctly

For essential operations that must continue regardless of battery state.

- **Requirements**: Must show a persistent notification.
- **Implementation**:
  ```kotlin
  val notification = NotificationCompat.Builder(context, CHANNEL_ID)
      .setContentTitle("Processing Data")
      .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_notification)
      .build()
      
  startForeground(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification)
  ```
- **Best Practice**: Use only when absolutely necessary as they're exempt from some battery optimizations.

## 9. Respect System Battery Optimizations

Work with the system rather than fighting against it.

- **Avoid**: Don't routinely ask users to disable battery optimizations.
- **Instead**: Design your app to work within system constraints.
- **Exception Handling**: Create graceful degradation paths when battery restrictions affect functionality.
